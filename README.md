### Prepping

First, get your **id**:

```

Now edit the **.env** file and swap out 501 for your own.

Run the following command to creat the volumes needed in order to send data to airflow:
```sh
mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins
```

And this **once**:
```sh
docker compose up airflow-init
```
If the exit code is 0 then it's all good.

```sh
docker compose up
```

After it is up, add a new connection:

* Name - postgres_default
* Conn type - postgres
* Host - localhost
* Port - 5432
* Database - airflow
* Username - airflow
* Password - airflow
